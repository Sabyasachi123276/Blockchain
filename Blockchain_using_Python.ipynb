        "\n",
        "Before we start building a blockchain using the Python programming language, let us go back to the very beginning. In 2008, an author (or authors) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper describing a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash. Exclusive to this electronic cash system, transactions wouldn't have to depend on third-party verifications to ensure the security of every transaction. Instead, every transaction would be timestamped, then hashed into an ongoing chain of proof-of-work based on the hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, what are hashing and proof-of-work? We will introduce these concepts in the following tutorial and understand how they establish the groundwork for an encrypted electronic cash system or cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto described the particular form of electronic currency in his (or her) paper became Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. However, how is this useful when attempting to build a blockchain using Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following tutorial, we will understand the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Understanding the Blockchain**\n",
        "\n",
        "The system that Bitcoin depends upon - a growing list of records (that is, blocks) that are connected to one another - is called Blockchain. Bitcoin was the first successful application of this system, and soon after its growth in fame, other cryptocurrencies were established on the same beliefs. However, this system is not limited to collecting financial information. Instead, the stored type of data is inconsequential and independent of the Blockchain network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fundamentally, the data stored in a blockchain should have consisted of the following characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable\n",
        "Distributed\n",
        "Persistent (no loss of data)\n",
        "Unhackable\n",
        "\n",
        "A blockchain is an open-source application that is shared between thousands of computers. These computers follow a set of rules in order to track money that has been sent from accounts tied to the blockchain software. These qualities are mandatory in order to maintain the Blockchain's integrity and the network security within which the transactions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Every block is a set of data that says, for instance, \"Tom paid Harry $500 on Tuesday, 14th.\" On the Blockchain, we can send the money without using a bank. In order to illustrate the simplicity and elegance of such a system and to describe the nuances, we will understand the process of creating our very own Blockchain using the Python programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the following project, we will only need Python. Also, remember that our Blockchain will be a simplified, high-level introduction. We won't be building an entire Bitcoin blockchain. Instead, we will be creating functions in order to add blocks, transactions, and encryption so that our data is temper-proof.\n",

        "In the above output, we can observe that our blockchain contains three blocks right now: The genesis block (with an index of 1 and no transactions), in addition to the 2 that we added ourselves. We can also notice that the encrypted hashes (derived from every preceding block) and the timestamps do not match each other. Granted, the computer constructed each block almost simultaneously as we executed the program and generated blocks at almost the same time; however, Bitcoin blocks are created approximately every ten minutes.\n",

        "Does anyone of us notice any account balances? Blockchains are not banks, and here is a good example to distinguish between the two. A cryptocurrency wallet will estimate the balance by scanning the complete chain and summing up how many coins we received and spent. We do not have to rely on a bank to tell us the amount present in the account. We are only trusting the network instead of one mega-corporation. Isn't it fascinating?"

        "In the following tutorial, we have successfully built a blockchain that we can fill with blocks full of transactions of cryptocurrency; however, this is not a secure network. First, we created a block any time somebody calls newBlock(), and there are no conditions. The newBlock() method requires a parameter called proof; however, that can be anything in our case. It can either be by a number or string saying, \"hello world\", or literally anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the network of Bitcoin, there is a consensus mechanism in a place called Proof of Work, which illustrates the rules by which security is achieved. A proof is a random number that is very difficult to find unless we have some dedicated high-performance machines working around the clock.\n",

        "There are many other details we are missing, such as fees for the miners to collect, a count of the transaction, public/private key, a Merkle tree structure, and more. However, the above walkthrough was helpful for us as a fundamental example of the moving segments in a blockchain."
